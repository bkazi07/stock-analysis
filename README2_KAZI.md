# Module 2 Challenge

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this module's challenge was to refactor the dataset of the stock market that was given . A VBA code was to be used in order to comb through all of the data at once. After that, the purpose was to find out whether refactoring the code really made the it work a lot better since it was using fewer steps. Refactoring the code would in turn help whoever was trying to read to code since it would be written in a more streamlined fashion that uses the least memory. 


## Results Comparing Stock Performance (look at pngs)

After taking a look at the results that were found at the end of the refactoring, it could be concluded that the code ran faster in the second year of 2018. When taking a look at the VBA_Challenge_2017.png, it said that the code ran in 0.663 seconds and when taking a look at the VBA_CHallenge_2018.png, it could be seen that the code ran in 0.645. After a year the code ran 0.018 seconds faster. The returns in the year 2017 were all in the green except for TERP. The returns in the year 2018 were pretty much all in the red besides ENPH and RUN which had positive yields for the year. This meant that it was a better year in 2017 for pretty much all stocks and for investors to get good returns. 


## Summary: Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code

There are many advantages to refactoring code. It helps with the design of the software as well as making it a lot more comprehensible. It also makes the program work a lot more efficiently. There is also a decrease in macro run time. This can be told by the run time analysis that can be seen in the 2017/2018 pngs. There are also many disadvantages to refactoring code. For example, if there is a part of code that has the same lines repeated throughout, it can make the code slower and less efficient. People often copy and paste the same part of the code throughout when there could be a more efficient way to write the code. Sometimes the programs will end up being too large to test the codes properly and the outcomes can come out incorrectly. 

## Summary: How the pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script

Throughout the time completing this challenge, I took several breaks. Everytime I came back to my computer, it took me a while to understand where exactly I had left off. This is when I realized that my code could benefit from refactoring. Refactoring my code made completing the rest of the challenge pretty straightforward since my code was organized. Since it was easy to maintain and I could easily find each part of the code, I was able to go in and switch out what I needed to in order to create the table for the 2017 data.
